## Beginner's Series to: JavaScript - Notes - Riku Lind NTIS23K

## Video 1

Introduces the instructors and what the course is about, giving a sense of what will be learned during the course.

## Video 2

Introduces JavaScript as a versatile programming language used almost everywhere, most notably in web development.

## Video 3

Compares JavaScript in the browser vs on the server, showing the differences between the two.

Learned that the performance is different in the browser and on the server, and that the Document Object Model is only available in the browser.

## Video 4

Introduces some tools like ESLint for code quality, Prettier for formatting, and ES6 snippets to get work done quicker with pre-written code shortcuts.

I learned that I'm a lazy coder and need ES6 snippets extension in VS Code ASAP.

## Video 5

Shows how to install these tools in VS Code, helping me set up my development environment.

## Video 6

Shows how to create a simple JavaScript application in VS Code to get hands-on experience.

## Video 7

Explains single-line and multi-line comments and how to use them in your code.

Although emphasizing their role in documenting and clarifying code, also notes that sometimes comments might make the code more bloated and less readable.

## Video 8

Demonstrates using comments in practice, showing how they make code easier to read and understand.

## Video 9

Introduces variable declaration with `let`, `const`, and `var`, explaining the differences in scope and in their behaviour.

For example, variables declared with `const` can't be changed after declaration.

## Video 10

Demonstrates declaring variables in VS Code to practice syntax.

## Video 11

Explains working with strings and combining them using concatenation with the `+` operator.

## Video 12

Shows string concatenation in VS Code with practical examples using the `+` operator.

## Video 13

Introduces template literals (backticks ``) for easier string formatting and including variables in strings.

## Video 14

Shows using template literals in VS Code, highlighting how they make string operations simpler.

## Video 15

Reviews different JavaScript data types and explains their use cases.

Simple type: number, float, string, boolean, date, function, array, object
Special type: NaN, null, undefined

## Video 16

Demonstrates how these data types work in practice in VS Code.

## Video 17

Explains math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, showing how JavaScript handles basic calculations with numbers.

## Video 18

Shows examples of performing math operations in VS Code to practice the syntax.

## Video 19

Covers converting between strings and numbers, which is important when working with user input, calculations or when comparing values/data types.

## Video 20

Demonstrates type conversion between strings and numbers in VS Code using `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()` and `ToString()` methods.

## Video 21

Introduces error handling with `try/catch/finally`, which is used to handle error safely in the code, so that the application doesn't crash when something goes wrong.

## Video 22

Shows practical error handling examples in VS Code, to get an idea how to handle exceptions safely.

I knew about error handling but haven't actually really used it before. This practical example helped me understand it better.

## Video 23

Covers working with dates and times using JavaScript’s `Date` object.

## Video 24

Demonstrates creating and manipulating dates in VS Code.

## Video 25

Explains Boolean logic, if statements and comparison operators.

The instructor thinks we should default to use triple-equals `===` instead of double-equals `==` because JavaScript automatically converts data types with `==`, which is not helpful in this case.

## Video 26

Shows examples of if statements and Boolean logic in VS Code, demonstrating how to handle multiple conditions in code.

## Video 27

Introduces switch (case) statements as an alternative to multiple if-else statements, which can sometimes be harder to read.

Noticed that I very rarely use switch (case) statements, so this helped me remember how it works compared to if statements.

## Video 28

Demonstrates switch statements in VS Code, showing how they handle multiple conditions efficiently.

## Video 29

Explains arrays as collections of data and how to create them, useful for storing lists of values.

## Video 30

Shows practical examples of creating arrays in VS Code.

## Video 31

Covers adding elements to arrays and accessing them by index, which is fundamental to array manipulation.

## Video 32

Demonstrates working with arrays in VS Code to practice adding and retrieving data.

## Video 33

Introduces array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()` and `concat()` to add or remove data from an array, or to join two or more arrays together.

## Video 34

Shows examples of using array methods in VS Code to manipulate data in an array.

## Video 35

Explains loops like `for`, `while` and `for ... of` for repeating actions or performing tasks multiple times.

## Video 36

Demonstrates loops in VS Code to showcase how they are useful in doing something multiple times.

## Video 37

Introduces functions as reusable blocks of code, showing how to create and call them.

## Video 38

Shows creating and using functions in VS Code to understand how they work in practice.

## Video 39

Explains arrow functions as an alternative way to write functions, used more in modern JavaScript.

## Video 40

Demonstrates arrow functions in VS Code and how they make function declaration simpler in some cases.

## Video 41

Introduces JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as a way store data and send it between different applications.

Now I understand what JSON actually does, it was a bit of gray area for me.

## Video 42

Shows practical examples of using JSON in VS Code, for example parsing and stringifying data.

## Video 43

Explains objects which hold data in pairs of keys and values so it’s easier to manage.

## Video 44

Demonstrates creating objects and getting their values in VS Code.

## Video 45

Introduces Promises as a way to handle asynchronous operations like for example fetching data from a database.

Found it funny how I was familiar with async/await before knowing what Promises were, or at least I didn't remember them being called Promises.

## Video 46

Shows practical use of Promises in VS Code, including `.then()` and `.catch()` for handling results and errors.

## Video 47

Explains async/await as a cleaner way to work with Promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and look like it's synchronous.

I remembered this topic vaguely, but didn't know the actual meaning behind it. This video made it more clear for me.

## Video 48

Demonstrates async/await in VS Code with examples of handling asynchronous tasks.

## Video 49

Introduces packages and npm, showing how pre-built libraries help with development.

## Video 50

Shows how to install and use packages in a JavaScript project in VS Code.

This proved to be very useful for me, since I didn't remember how npm and packages worked.

## Video 51

Provides additional learning resources to continue improving JavaScript skills after the course.
